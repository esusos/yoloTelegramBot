# yoloTelegramBot
YOLOV1 implementation with PyTorch.  Telegram bot with pretrained YOLOV5 interated in it


The objective of this project was to implement the YOLOv1 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm using the PyTorch framework and to integrate it with a Telegram Bot. The YOLOv1 algorithm is a real-time object detection system that is known for its fast processing time and high accuracy. 

The integration with a Telegram Bot was aimed at making the object detection process more accessible and user-friendly.
Implementation of YOLOv1 using PyTorch:


The YOLOv1 algorithm was implemented using PyTorch, an open-source machine learning framework. The architecture of YOLOv1 was implemented from scratch, including the anchor boxes and objectness scores. Due to computational limitations the model was trained on 100 images from the Pascal VOC dataset.


Due to computational limitations, the model was not trained from scratch and instead, the already pretrained YOLOv5 model was used. This was integrated into the Telegram Bot to make the object detection process more accessible and user-friendly.
